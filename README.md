# Custom translator

[SC Translator](https://github.com/chunibyocola/sc-translator-crx) is a great extension for providing inline translation of a web page

_"Translate with multiple translation sources at the same time / Translation history in single webpage / Separated translate window / Customize theme / Text preprocessing / Translation Collection / Webpage translation ... All these features are provided by **ScTranslator**."_

SC translator comes with a pluggable architecture for different translation engines â€“ and a great mechanism to integrate own translators. This makes the extension perfect for using it in corporate environments with trained specialized vocabularies.
At the same time, using other translators is often prohibited due to data privacy concerns.
Since the maintainer of SC translator didn't want to make the list of translators, this repository features a reduced version of SC translator
